4141496_15|And I'm not necessarily talking about some of the things that we've discussed in the past, though they are meaningful.
4141496_16|I'm not talking about data or analytics or technology or shifting distribution or change in customer behavior or any of those things that get a lot of headlines and are meaningful again.
4141496_22|From our perspective this is a double plus, if you will.
4141496_26|I think others are still beginning to get their head around it, but from our perspective it is consequential for many stakeholders.
4141496_38|It continues to be a reality that this industry seems to struggle with.
4141496_39|From our perspective, we are hoping that when the day's all done, the industry is going to be able to be more successful in getting their head around this idea of risk in return and appropriately factoring volatility to when they think about this concept.
4141496_56|Clearly, pricing is moving up and cat-exposed pricing is moving up even more.
4141496_62|It's difficult to say when that is going to occur, but quite frankly, based on how we see planets and the starts lining up we would think that it would take 12, maybe 18 months at the most, but probably sooner rather than later given the amount of pain.
4141496_79|I don't know how many it is in a row, but it's a lot at this stage.
4141496_82|We've talked a little bit in the past about loss trends.
4141496_95|I don't think you're going to see that spread much more, but again we are pretty well-positioned for a rising interest rate environment.
4141496_97|I will leave it there and turn it over to Rich.
4141496_102|Pretax underwriting income was $81 million, largely unchanged from the year ago quarter.
4141496_109|The accident year loss ratio before cat was 60.7% compared with 60.1% the year ago.
4141496_138|At this time, we estimate the effective tax rate should approximate the marginal rate of 21%.
4141496_148|Okay, if we could please open it up for questions now.
4141496_153|And I was wondering if you could sort of sketch that out a bit more and this goes back to the comment you made on the tax benefit not getting competed away on, I guess, the commercial and specialty lines versus personal lines.
4141496_156|So when you think about at least the space that we operate in and a significant number of our specialty commercial lines competitors, they are parent, if you will, are domiciled outside of the United States.
4141496_161|They are either going to change their pricing and raise it.
4141496_166|They need to with -- they are going to have to figure out how they compete.
4141496_174|And from our perspective, it does not impact or change the opportunity that we see for Berkley One both in the short, intermediate and long-term.
4141496_176|And then just one final question on, I guess, on the reinsurance and it was interesting to listen to your comments.
4141496_185|So my view is that we'll have to see how it unfolds.
4141496_186|But we think we have a great team of people both domestically as well as outside of the U.S. And they know the expectation is to make money, not to issue treaties or reserves.
4141496_201|So we will need to, obviously, do our best to maximize the profits in the right place.
